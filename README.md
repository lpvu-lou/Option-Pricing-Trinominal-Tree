# Trinomial Tree Option Pricer (VBA + Python/Streamlit)

A practical project to price vanilla European/American options with a **recombining trinomial tree** in:
- **VBA (Excel)**: quick pricing directly in spreadsheets (macro friendly + xlwings).
- **Python + Streamlit**: interactive web app for pricing, Greeks, and parameter sensitivity to compare the difference between European and American option.
